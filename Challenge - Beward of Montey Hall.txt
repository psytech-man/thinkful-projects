I would choose to switch the door. My reasoning is that the host has just given you a very valuable new information. At the outset of the problem, the probability of selecting the door with a fantastic prize is 1/3. After the host reveals the dud, it feels like the probability would now be 1/2 for both the door you selected and the remaining door. But the trick is to apply Bayes' Rule. The difference between Bayesian and Frequentist schools of thought on probability is that Bayesians distinguish between "prior probability" and "posterior probability." They believe that the probability is updated each time an experiment is run if the new data resulting from the experiment changes your expectations. So in this case, a new experiment was run when the host opened the door. So you have to think about the prior 2/3 probability of getting a dud and the posterior 1/2 probability of getting a dud. I'm not sure how to properly move from this idea to my conclusion, but I just have the intuition that it's better to switch your selection because the host chose to open one of two doors, not including yours, so you now have more information about the unopened door that you did not initially select.
